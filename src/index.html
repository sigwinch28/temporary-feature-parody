    <!-- This cover is a temporary feature
		as part of the installation of upgraded
		Digital Advertising displays.
		Each display will carry a blend of
		commercial advertising and public service
		messaging across two state-of-the-art
		86" digital screens. Designed for
		Manchester, the displays will feature
		the logos of Manchester City Council and the
		iconic Manchester bee and will be powered by
		renewable energy and maintained by
		technicians driving electric vehicles, limiting
		any carbon emissions.
		The works are scheduled to be completed by
		December 2021. Please note that the current
		footprint of the cabinet is not representative
		of the final display. -->
